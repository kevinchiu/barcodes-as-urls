<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>This program recognizes barcodes that contain URLs and
launches the iPhone's browser with any URL that is detected.

<h2>System requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jailbroken iPhone</li>
<li>Computer</li>
<li>Wifi access point</li>
</ul>
<h2>Installation instructions</h2>
<h3>Installation Preparation</h3>
<ol>
<li>On your jailbroken iPhone, use the Installer application to install
the BSD subsystem and SSH Server.</li> </ol>
<h3>Application installation</h3>
<ol>
<li>Go to Home Screen > Settings > Wifi and connect to a Wifi access
point.</li>
<li>Press the right arrow next to the access point you are connected to.
Record the IP address of your phone.</li>
<li>Connect to the same access point using a computer.</li>
<li>cd to the directory with the Reader.app application.</li>
<li>Issue the following command where IP is the phone's IP address you
recorder earlier. <pre>scp -r Reader.app root@IP:/Applications</pre>
Your password is most likely "alpine" without the quotes. Alternatively,
you can use the SFTP program of your choice to do this transfer.</li>
<li>Reboot the phone.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Operation</h2>
<p>To launch the app, touch it from the home screen. To recognize a
barcode, position the barcode into the field of view of the camera, and
press the screen. The screen will freeze while the application is
recognizing the barcode. If the recognition succeeds, Safari will launch
the URL in the barcode. If the recognition fails, the camera preview
will be unfrozen and you will be able to try the recognition again.

<h2>Program internal operation</h2>
<p>Internally, the application uses the iPhone's camera to take a
picture. The picture is then sent to a recognizer where it is decoded,
if possible. When the picture is decoded, the decoded URL is passed to
Safari, the phone's internal browser.

<h2>Things that do not work</h2>
<p>The application has a very high failure rate under real world
conditions. Also, it only works with URLs. Recognizing any other piece
of encoded data may have unexpected results.

<h2>Useful enhancements</h2>
<p>It may be helpful to implement a preprocessing step in which the <a

color constancy algorithm is performed. This would enhance the
application's performance under difficult lighting situations.

<p>Also, it would be nice if the application handled things other than
URLs intelligently. For example, if address book information were
encoded in the barcode, then a new contact entry should be created on
the phone.

QR Code Library</a>.
